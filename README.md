# Max-msp-learning-curve
My journey in learning Cycling74's Max MSP. Sharing my learning curve with the world. 

This is about getting some real experience in Max MSP, a very cool and inifite tool for 
building electronic music projects, from synths to complete art installations and everthing 
in between. 

I will write about my journey on my blog, www.cornerman.net

And here I will share the design documents, and the patches itself. 
I hope you'll enjoy. 

Learning is a superpower.
